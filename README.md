# cards
Hello!  This small project is intended to simulate a deck of cards.  Each time you select the "play cards" button on 
the home screen, the deck will be newly "shuffled".  Tap the card for a new card, or press back to go back to 
the previous card.  A long press on the back button will take you back to the home screen for a new game.

Thanks for checking this out ! (+:
